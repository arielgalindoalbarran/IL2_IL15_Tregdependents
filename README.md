# **IL-2 and IL-15 drive intrathymic development of distinct periphery-seeding CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T lymphocytes**

Development of Foxp3-expressing regulatory T-lymphocytes (Treg) in the thymus is controlled by signals delivered in T-cell precursors via the TCR, co-stimulatory receptors, and cytokine receptors. In absence of IL-2, IL-15 or their receptors, fewer Treg apparently develop in the thymus. However, it was recently shown that a substantial part of thymic Treg are cells that had recirculated from the periphery back to the thymus, troubling interpretation of these results. We therefore reassessed the involvement of IL-2 and IL-15 in the development of Treg, taking into account Treg-recirculation. We found that in absence of IL-2 substantially less Treg developed than in absence of IL-15. IL-2 and IL-15 differentially modulated the CD25, OX40, GITR, 4-1BB, PD-1 and CD73-phenotypes of thymus-egress-competent and periphery-seeding Treg. Interestingly, IL-2 and IL-15 also modulated the repertoire of TCR expressed by developing Treg. Despite their qualitative differences, Treg developing in an IL-2- vs. IL-15-dependent manner had largely (but incompletely) redundant roles in the suppression of autoimmune pathology in Treg-reconstituted scurfy mice. Taken together, our results firmly establish important quantitative and qualitative roles for IL-2 and IL-15 in intrathymic Treg-development.
