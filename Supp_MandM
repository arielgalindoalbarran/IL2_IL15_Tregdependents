Processing of TCRseq data
Initially, reads were processed with the toolkit pRESTO (2) as follows. Using FilterSeq, reads with a quality higher than 20 were selected. Using MaskPrimers and PairSeq algorithms, the sequences corresponding to the Tcra constant region (AGCAGGTTCTGGGTTCTGGA) and indicating location of the UMI (CTTGGGGG) were searched for and indexed to the head of the paired reads. Using BuildConsensus, consensus-sequences of the reads with the same UMI were constructed. Next, the forward and reverse reads were aligned to assemble the Tcra sequences (AssemblePairs) and the UMI groups containing at least two reads were selected. The sequenced fragments from each selected UMI were aligned to the Tcra genomic region using the toolkit MiXCR (3), with the tools “align” and “assemble”. The aligned fragments were exported as data tables “clonotype-tables” using the tool “exportClones”. Using VDJtools (4) these clonotype-tables were then processed to graph with customized scripts in R. For all graphics described below, the “clonotypes” were selected according to their differences in the amino-acid sequences of the V segments, CDR3, and J segments. The diversity-measures of the total Tcra repertoires were calculated using the command CalcDiversityStats from VDJtools (Chao1 and Shannon-Wiener) and the R package “divo” (Morista-Horn). For the Morista-Horn calculation, a previous filtered step was performed (Clonotypes with UMIs > 5 was selected) “Public repertoires” were defined as the clonotypes present in all four replicates for each condition.
